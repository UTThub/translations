Scarcity defines the Broken Lands. The terrain is mostly nonarable, the cities small and scattered, the people hard and fiercely self-sufficient. Survival is a constant battle that leaves little time for less pressing concerns. Countries in this region lack the prestigious artistic, academic, and cultural institutions that the empires to the south enjoy, but they also lack the extreme inequality and social rigidity that can hobble advancement in those lands. Here, a person’s fate is in their own hands, and destiny is for the bold to forge. 

Both natural climate and historical disasters have shaped these nations. The rocky, wind-scoured hills of northern Brevoy and the mosquito-infested swamps of the River Kingdoms are impossible to cultivate, while the irradiated wastelands of Numeria and the demon-haunted Sarkoris Scar are even less hospitable. Arable farmland in the region is limited to southern Brevoy, parts of the Sellen River basin scattered across Razmiran and the River Kingdoms, and tiny pockets in Mendev and Numeria. As a realm’s stability depends on keeping its people fed, the breadbaskets of Rostland take on outsize importance in Brevoy, and Razmiran’s fertile farmland is a major reason its masked god’s rule goes unchallenged. 

The region’s history has unfurled against, and continues to be guided by, this backdrop of scarcity. Centuries ago, an immense starship fell from the night sky and shattered across Numeria in the Rain of Stars, seeding its land with untold wonders and dangers. In a more developed realm, those mysteries might have been dissected and cataloged long ago, but because Numeria was and is a sparsely populated land of superstitious folk, those star-fallen relics have remained largely unexplored to this day. 

When the Worldwound erupted in the north and spewed demons onto Golarion, the Abyssal armies scythed through thinly settled Sarkoris without meaningful resistance. Fiends consumed that entire realm before the crusaders of neighboring Mendev, aided by soldiers from across the Inner Sea, were able to stem the tide. For decades, southern nations sent soldiers and supplies northward to bolster the crusade’s defenses, but when the Worldwound closed and new threats arose closer to home, those nations pulled their support away. Now, though the gravest danger has been sealed off, countless demons and their corruptions remain scattered across the Sarkoris Scar and the battlegrounds of Mendev, and few stand ready to face them. 

Wild, perilous, and largely uncharted, the Broken Lands are filled with dangers and mysteries both ancient and modern. Civilization is a fragile thing here, and in the vastness of the woods and lakes and windswept tundra, spirits and stranger things rule.

## Brevoy 

Two hundred and twenty years ago, Choral the Conqueror swept into the rival kingdoms of Issia and Rostland, welding the former foes into the single nation of Brevoy with sword and dragon flame. Choral founded the royal House Rogarvia, and his descendants ruled the new nation for 200 years. Yet the old enmities between Issia and Rostland, which had been held in check only by force, never healed. When Choral reapportioned his new kingdom among the seven great families of Brevoy, he changed their titles and leadership but largely kept the boundaries of their holdings intact. Thus the legal and cultural borders between Issia and Rostland survived, and when every member of House Rogarvia vanished in a single night without a trace, Brevoy’s noble families swiftly fell back into their feuds. Today, 20 years after the Vanishing, Brevoy remains on the brink of civil war despite diplomats’ heroic efforts to mend the country’s fractures. 

The closing of the Worldwound has increased trade along the Lake of Mists and Veils, and resettlement of formerly demon-plagued lands has driven up Mendev’s demand for Brevoy’s hardy livestock and seed grain. Meanwhile, Tar-Baphon’s ascent over Lake Encarthan has shifted much southern trade to the Sellen River, which originates in Brevoy. Yet while the rich farmlands of Rostland produce most of the nation’s goods, Issia’s sailors control shipping and pocket most of the profits. Rostlanders, who have long believed their labor is exploited by the sly, clevertongued Issians—who are, after all, outright pirates before they were conquered by Choral—grow increasingly frustrated by this perceived unfairness. Issia’s merchant princes argue that they supply the ships and negotiate the trade agreements that bring wealth to all, and if they can’t invest adequately in their shipping fleets, they risk losing trade to foreign rivals. Meanwhile, commoners’ discontent and complaints about their taxes being “stolen” by Issia echoes ever-louder in their lords’ halls. 

A potential marriage alliance between reigning House Surtova and wealthy House Lebeda, which might have closed the fissure between Rostland and Issia, came to an abrupt halt when Natala Surtova, sister to the king, accused Lord Lander Lebeda of treason. The young lord vanished in response, leaving the would-be bride Elanna Lebeda to return home in solidarity against the inevitable aggression from the reigning house of Brevoy. As Lander had been plagued with rumors of revolutionary sentiments since his youth, many nobles in Brevoy consider this to be simply one more way the lord has embarrassed his house, but the details of his supposed treason are muddled and contradictory. House Orlovsky in particular is adamant that the accusations are foul play on the part of the Surtovas, and the strain between the two houses, already pushed to the breaking point, has boiled over past the point of reason. 

Adding to these tensions, the end of the Mendevian Crusade left many soldiers idle. Some of the less reputable soldiers came to Brevoy, joining the great houses as mercenaries or studying under Aldori swordlords. These ex-crusaders tend to be a volatile lot, scarred by demon-haunted pasts and unfazed by casual violence, and contribute to a darkening national mood. 

Finally, the recent unsealing of the walled city of Skywatch has unnerved many. Built around a mysterious ancient observatory, the city ended all communications with the outside world on the same day that the Rogarvias disappeared. Months ago, without fanfare, the city gates opened and the strange magic that had cloaked Skywatch against divination vanished, although no one knows how or why. Stranger still, though their well-maintained homes and clean-swept streets indicate that Skywatch’s inhabitants continued their everyday lives until quite recently, no living person remains within the walls. They were not alone there, however—curious footprints suggest that something left the city when its gates opened. 

### Aldori Dueling Sword 

The legendary Brevic swordsman Sirian Aldori achieved great renown for his unmatched skill at swordplay. The students he accepted—whom he required to swear an oath dedicating their lives to his secret techniques—became the Aldori swordlords. The specialized Aldori dueling sword stands above all other weapons in the eyes of the Aldori swordlords, and only those with a swordlord’s elite training are able to wield one effectively.

## The Lake of Mists and Veils

The enormous freshwater lake that borders Brevoy, Numeria, Mendev, and Iobaria takes its name from the dense fog that steams from its surface each winter morning, burning off slowly throughout the day. Lesser clouds drift across its waves year-round, and some say that veils of fog sometimes swirl even below the water. In winter, the lake spawns storms that hammer northern Brevoy with hail and snow. 

Pirates, fishers, and traders ply the lake’s waters, and soothsayers purport to read omens in its mists. Yet those who spend the most time on the Lake of Mists and Veils claim to know it least, for they alone have glimpsed the mysteries within its waves. 

One such wonder is the Jundlan Wrecks, a frost-rimed tangle of broken ships and ancient, half-frozen corpses in Jellicoe Bay—the floating legacy of a massive naval battle between the long-dead pirate lords of Issia. Malevolent fey are said to haunt the storm-crushed wreckage, building altars and eldritch palaces from the dead pirates’ treasure. On moonless nights, ghostly bells sound the midnight hour, and gangplanks of frost-bound human bone unfurl from the desolate ships, inviting anyone and no one to a destination unknown. 

Another mystery lies north of Chesed, beyond the shore’s sight, where a still patch of water lies undisturbed by wind or wave. Deep under the surface, the dim outline of some enormous hulk can just be glimpsed, its opaque black surface untouched by silt or water weeds. Twice in living memory, the mysterious structure has belched up great bubbles of sweet-smelling gas. Both incidents resulted in massive fish kills and caused violent hallucinations among ships’ crews exposed to the gas. Some victims died, others developed strange new abilities, and a few simply had their consciousness destroyed, becoming senseless husks ever after.

## Mendev

For well over a century, the defining fact of life in the crusader kingdom of Mendev was the Worldwound: a reality-warping Abyssal rift west of the realm that threatened to consume all of Golarion. Heroes from across Avistan and beyond answered the call to meet the demonic horde. As the years rolled into decades, however, and the hope of victory grew ever fainter, the once-bright crusade began to tarnish. Infiltrated by fiendish agents sowing treachery and paranoia, the crusade’s inquisitors turned their tools against indigenous Mendevians, whose animist religions seemed suspect to the crusaders. On the front lines, the steady toll of battle forced commanders to accept recruits who were more often than not criminals and exiles driven by desperation rather than conviction. 

Then, just when it seemed that all might be lost, a miracle occurred: a small band of brave souls discovered and carried out a ritual to seal the Worldwound, slaying the demon lord Deskari and ending the existential threat that had defined Mendev for decades. Seemingly overnight, the demonic host collapsed into disarray, Queen Galfrey’s army swept forward, and the Fifth Mendevian Crusade declared victory. 

Now Mendev faces the long, hard task of rebuilding a nation that has almost forgotten who it was before the war. Queen Galfrey stepped forward to become Iomedae's new herald, and most of her holy knights have departed, with many marching south to face the resurgent threat of Tar-Baphon—although a few have instead chosen to square themselves against evils such as the nascent demon lord Treerazer in Kyonin’s Tanglebriar. 

In their absence, the fledgling civilian government is hard-pressed to meet the nation’s needs. Chancellor Irahai, appointed by the queen before her abdication, is a wise and clever governor, but hobbled by the widespread belief that her authority holds less weight in comparison to her predecessor. 

Political divisions that were suppressed under martial law—such as between native Mendevians, who have long been pushed to the margins in their own land, and the foreigners who held authority during the crusade—have risen in peacetime. The end of the crusade has also meant an end to the money and labor that outside faiths and nations sent north to stave off the demonic threat, leaving Mendev with only its own war-depleted resources to draw upon. 

In addition to these difficulties, Mendev still contends with supernatural menaces. The sealing of the Worldwound did not eliminate the demons already on Golarion, and Mendev remains crucial as a staging ground for holy champions who have pledged to fight until the last fiend has been driven out. The frost-antlered shades of the Estrovian Forest and the cursed ruins of Icerift Castle, ignored during the war, remain threats as well. 

Yet this cold and perilous land holds wonder, too. Mendev’s immense forests, white-crowned mountains, and snow-swept steppes are starkly beautiful. Scattered among them are the bones and dreams of dead generations, some who tried to tame an unyielding land and some who sought escape from the horrors of a seemingly endless war. All of them, and all their treasures, have vanished under snow and trees—but not all are forgotten. 

Today, Kellids from the tribes of lost Sarkoris are returning to reclaim their devastated homeland. Some crusaders, hoping to atone for the cruelties inflicted by overzealous fanatics in the past, have sworn to help them. Knowing this, the surviving demons have taken to hiding their own soul-poisoning magics as relics of indigenous Sarkorian faith, as most outlanders cannot distinguish true relics from false ones.

## Numeria

Toward the end of the Age of Darkness, a great fireball with a smoking heart of steel broke apart in the night skies above Numeria, shattering into fragments—some as small as fists, others large as cities—that buried themselves across the rocky plains. These strange relics from another world beyond the stars have shaped life for the grim, survivalist tribes of Numeria ever since. 

Invisible emanations mutate the native animal and plant life into warped forms; horrors slumbering in cold chambers meant to voyage between the stars sometimes awaken and escape. Vast swaths of Numeria are cratered, irradiated wastelands populated by metalclawed monsters with eyes of burning light. But skymetal and fragments of technology are powerful resources, and the lure of such wealth draws the brave and foolish alike. 

The native people of Numeria are hard-bitten Kellids, mostly hunters and herders with a dark, superstitious worldview shaped by their unforgiving land and its star-flung hazards. The fiercest warlord in each generation traditionally takes the title of the Black Sovereign and claims rulership of Numeria, but in practice most tribes have their own leaders and pay little heed to a far-off sovereign, believing only peasants and soft city folk bow their heads to such claims. 

This is particularly true for the current Black Sovereign, a once-mighty warrior named Kevoth-Kul, who conquered the city of Starfall in his youth. Some believed Kevoth-Kul would lead Numeria to glory on a red tide of conquest. Instead, he succumbed to the influence of the Technic League, a cabal of secretive arcanists and researchers obsessed with unlocking the secrets of Numerian technology. 

The Technic League plied Kevoth-Kul with the mind-altering fluids that seeped from the walls of Silver Mount, the vast and unimaginably complex edifice of alien technology half-buried in the earth outside Starfall. Soon the Black Sovereign was hopelessly addicted to these fluids, and lapsed into erratic, moody indolence. 

Recently, however, the Captain of the Technic League died under closely concealed circumstances. Brave souls whisper tales of a strange new goddess arising from the core of Silver Mount following the captain’s demise, but the truth of these rumors is unknown. What is certain is that the Technic League fell into squabbling, murderous disarray within weeks. 

The survivors largely fled Starfall, and the Black Sovereign, freed from their control, has begun to break fitfully free from his addiction. Many fear that if he regains his senses, Kevoth-Kul will resume his campaign of conquest across Numeria. Since most Numerians have grown accustomed to semi-independence and no longer trust their tyrannical, unstable ruler, this is not a welcome prospect. 

The alternative, however, may be worse. While the Black Sovereign remained lost in his decades-long haze of intoxication, other warlords began claiming their own territories in Numeria. The collapse of the Technic League has greatly increased these warlords’ power, as many former League members sought positions as advisors, and those new allies brought along their arsenals of stolen technology. 

Now, the warlords and their Technic League advisors are locked in an all-out arms race, each one vying to hoard the most powerful technology. While this has ensured that Numerian technology remains jealously guarded within the nation and does not reach neighboring lands, it also raises the risk that Numeria’s civil war, if it comes, will prove devastating.

## Razmiran

The oppressive theocracy of Razmiran, ruled by the masked priests of a masked god, has long been viewed with wariness by its neighbors. A young nation, Razmiran was carved out of the neighboring River Kingdoms only a little over 50 years ago. Yet unlike most of the short-lived countries that rise and fall in that tumultuous region, Razmiran seems grimly stable—for it, unlike the kingdoms claimed by mere mortal lords, is ruled by a living god. 

Few have seen the living god, but Razmir’s presence in his kingdom is inescapable. His masked priests maintain tight control over society, acting as enforcers more than spiritual guides. Their distinctive temples, which are always centered around a massive set of stone steps leading up to a gold or silver mask, stand in every village and market square. These steps represent the 31 steps Razmir is said to have undertaken to pass the Test of the *Starstone* and attain divinity, and they are a recurring motif in both theocratic rhetoric and the physical layout of Razmiran’s public spaces. 

At present, Razmir’s people take some solace in the constant reminders that they are personally protected by a deity. Soon after Tar-Baphon’s resurgence and the destruction of Lastwall, Razmiran signaled that it would not oppose the Whispering Tyrant so long as the lich did not disturb the living god or his domain. This bargain appears to have been satisfactory to both parties, and thus Razmiran, alone among the nations bordering Lake Encarthan, appears poised to remain neutral in the coming conflict between Tar-Baphon and the other regional powers. 

Yet there are hints that this peace has been purchased at a ghastlier price than the priests acknowledge. Rumors persist that Razmiran is “donating” its dead to the Whispering Tyrant’s armies in exchange for safety from the undead horde. These claims remain unconfirmed, in part because taboos concerning the uncleanliness of the dead are so strong in Razmiran that bodies are seldom viewed by family before being consigned to communal mausoleums, and in part because many of the dead are said to come from the massive prison mines of the Forgotten Track, where the condemned have disappeared quietly for years. Those who repeat these rumors often wonder, however, what might happen when Razmiran—never an overly populous country—runs out of corpses. 

Perhaps even more troubling are the cautious whispers from those near the clergy that Razmir himself has begun to act erratically, becoming oddly withdrawn from his priests. With the Whispering Tyrant a terrifying new threat in the region, this lapse in Razmir’s attentions—and perhaps his protection—frightens his faithful. As of yet, however, this fear remains relatively unknown outside the most secretive circles in the capital city of Thronestep and the remote, sacred fortress of First Step. 

So far, everyday life in Razmiran has not drastically changed. The poor remain grindingly downtrodden, taxed nearly to starvation, while Razmir’s clergy feast and indulge in every vice. In the wild Exalted Wood and the bustling crossroads town of Pilgrimage, outlaws and apostates dream of breaking the masked god’s rule. That realizing these dreams may prove far more dangerous thanks to Tar-Baphon’s rise does not dissuade them, for those crushed by tyranny are rarely able to see farther than the boot on their necks.

## The River Kingdoms

Scattered among the forests and marshes of the Sellen River basin are the River Kingdoms: a loose confederation of tiny, independent states, the largest of them holding only a few thousand souls. Hundreds of such kingdoms have risen and fallen over the centuries, for treachery and chaos are rife in this region, and few River Kingdoms outlive their founders. Within just the past few years, for instance, the kingdom of Pitax fell after an overambitious attempt to extend its borders, while a new kingdom arose out of the former Stolen Lands bordering Brevoy. 

The lawless reputation of the River Kingdoms draws outcasts, refugees, and anyone else so desperate to escape their pasts that carving out a new life in a rough frontier town seems like an attractive proposition. Such settlers rarely have much money, and as the skills developed in their homelands are often ill suited to hardscrabble lives in the river basin, they generally find it difficult to rebuild their fortunes. The region is further depressed by the River Kingdoms’ instability, which deters trade, investment, and even travel. Thus, most of the River Kingdoms are poor, isolated, and backward—but stubbornly, proudly free. 

Some of the current River Kingdoms include the following.

### Daggermark 

The largest and most stable of the River Kingdoms, Daggermark is renowned for its sister guilds of assassins and poisoners. It also hosts the annual Outlaw Council, where the leaders of the various kingdoms gather to plan the means by which they protect their freedom from the larger forces arrayed against them. This is the closest that the River Kingdoms come to having a unified government, and every year’s session is contentious. 

### Leydis 

The fallen city of Leydis is a moss-cloaked ruin of marble buildings and crumbling, water-stained mosaics. Founded by a Taldan prospector in a region once known as Loric Fells, it collapsed shortly after its first buildings rose. The grandeur of its remains and the rich mines that surround it have proved irresistible, however, and Leydis is forever being claimed by adventurers or monsters. 

None have held the city for more than a year, and often the next creature to venture into the ruins finds nothing but stripped skeletons dangling from the walls. The medusa Chryphaena and her blind zombies currently inhabit Leydis; it remains to be seen whether the medusa will fare better than the ruins’ previous claimants. 

### Sevenarches 

Founded among the remains of sacred elven ruins, Sevenarches is currently in the hands of Oakstewards, secretive druids who have ruled the land since Kyonin’s elves departed Golarion to escape Earthfall. While the elves have a vested interest in reclaiming this holy site, the Oakstewards continue to refuse entry due to the Obnubilate plague, a contagious and lethal disease that claims any elf who approaches the ruined arches. 

### Tymon 

Famed for its prestigious gladiators and sensational arena battles, the city-state of Tymon makes its living selling spectacle and pride. Influential citizens from other River Kingdoms often visit Tymon in order to cheer on their favored warriors. These charismatic gladiators can inspire such devotion that political feuds, murders, and even petty wars have occurred due to disagreements between their fans.

## Sarkoris Scar 

The region formerly called the Worldwound is now known as the Sarkoris Scar, after the jagged, ugly gash of blackened and broken rock that runs across the land where the Abyssal rift once yawned. Now that the rip between worlds has been sealed and the demon lord Deskari slain, the scattered descendants of Sarkoris dare to dream of reclaiming their ancestral land, though the task that looms before them is forbidding. 

Despite Deskari’s death and the scattering of his host, the northlands remain fraught with threats. Although the sealing of the Worldwound cut off the demons’ never-ending reinforcements, it did not kill those fiends already present or purify the blight pervading the landscape. Most of the Mendevian Crusade’s might has been redirected to face Tar-Baphon far to the south, and the holy crusaders who remain are no longer as numerous or as vigilant as they once were. 

The demon-haunted ruins of Storasta, Undarin, and Iz—three Sarkorian cities that were overrun shortly after the Worldwound opened—have each been reclaimed, but the prospect of rebuilding on such defiled sites was so daunting that the victors razed and abandoned them instead. For now, the soot-stained mines outside Iz and the murky Sarkora River, flowing over the rubble of Undarin, have been left to demons and the dead. 

Nevertheless, a small but courageous coalition of crusaders, adherents of the Green Faith, children of lost Sarkoris, and the old Sarkorian gods is determined to restore what it can. Their only permanent outpost is the small town of Gundrun, which they have built up into a walled and warded fort stockpiled with supplies. Otherwise, these self-proclaimed Reclaimers prefer a nomadic lifestyle. In part, this is because the witch-wardens and warriors of old Sarkoris viewed the wanderer’s way as cleaner and nobler than the hierarchical life of towns, but the Reclaimers also favor nomadism because the Sarkoris Scar remains too dangerous to settle. Until more of the region has been purified, any attempt at large-scale encampment outside Gundrun seems profoundly unwise. 

Rather than rebuild cities, the Reclaimers focus on restoring wildlands. The mystical city of Dyinglight and its ring of aurora idols, and the repositories of ancient druidic traditions hidden deep in the Shudderwood, are two of their primary targets. However, both of these sites remain in corrupted hands: Dyinglight is surrounded by clans of fiendish, cannibalistic giants, while the Shudderwood’s native fey have been corrupted into tormented and perverted forms. 

Even the wild animals who roam those lands show the lingering touch of the Abyss in their glowing eyes, unnatural stench, and rampant bloodlust. Still, the Reclaimers are making slow, painful progress. There is no safety in the Sarkoris Scar—not yet. But for the first time in a long while, there is hope. 

## The Sellen River 

The heavily trafficked Sellen River is the longest and most expansive of Avistan’s rivers. With the rise of Tar-Baphon hindering trade across Lake Encarthan, the Sellen River has become even more crucial to the cultural and economic lives of the nations it connects. Originating in the Lake of Mists and Veils, the river runs south through Numeria and the eastern River Kingdoms before serving as a natural border for many of Avistan’s central nations, then spilling into the Inner Sea. Its primary tributaries—the East and West Sellen Rivers—are vital trade routes linking Mendev, the Sarkoris Scar, and Brevoy to the wealthier and more populous nations in central and southern Avistan. 

The northern reaches of the Sellen River are subject to harsh winters that choke the waters with ice and lash travelers with frigid, blinding winds. As the river and its tributaries run south, the current slows and the waterway broadens, no longer confined to leaping rapids between walls of glacier-carved rock. Grasslands and rich forests unfurl on the riverbanks, and outposts become more common. 

Because trade along the Sellen River is so crucial to every nation it touches, most realms maintain regulated harbors and riverside towns where travelers can enjoy a degree of safety, generally in exchange for taxes and tolls. The river is too vast for anyone to completely control it, however, and smugglers, pirates, and cutthroats flourish along its less populated reaches. An entire secondary economy has sprung up to shield travelers from these threats, but it’s an open secret that many river pilots and mercenary escorts switch sides to play pirate when their legitimate business slows.

Circa 

–4363 AR Before the Age of Anguish, the Kellid people of Numeria witness the Rain of Stars. 

4499 AR Choral the Conqueror unites Issia and Rostland as the newly founded kingdom of Brevoy. 

4606 AR The Worldwound opens in Sarkoris. Demons pour forth from the rip in reality and quickly consume the entire nation, leaving only ruin. 

4622 AR The First Mendevian Crusade begins. 

4638 AR The city of Drezen falls to the demon horde, signaling the first crusade’s defeat. In response, the Second Mendevian Crusade is called and establishes the *wardstones* as a mystical defense that tenuously contains the Worldwound’s blight. 

4661 AR Razmir, the Living God, declares himself in the River Kingdoms and swiftly conquers several smaller holds, uniting them as the new realm of Razmiran. 

4665 AR The Third Mendevian Crusade is called, but soon sinks into factional infighting and persecution of indigenous Kellid and Sarkorian animist faiths. 

4692 AR The Fourth Mendevian Crusade is called in response to the rise of the balor Khorramzadeh. The Order of Heralds reins in the purges of the Third Crusade. 

4699 AR The royal House Rogarvia vanishes from Brevoy, and the city of Skywatch is mysteriously sealed. Later that year, House Surtova claims Brevoy’s crown. 

4707 AR The Fourth Crusade ends in a stalemate between demons and crusaders, with the demons forced into retreat but the forces of Mendev too exhausted to fight further. 

4716 AR Numeria’s Technic League shatters following the unexplained death of its leader. Rumors begin circulating of a new goddess rising from Silver Mount. 

4718 AR A small band of heroes slays the demon lord Deskari and seals the Worldwound, bringing the Fifth Mendevian Crusade to a glorious victory. Many exhausted and traumatized veterans leave soon after. 

4718 AR Efforts to reclaim the Sarkoris Scar begin in earnest, but it soon becomes apparent that the cities lost to the Worldwound are too corrupted to salvage. Storasta, Undarin, and Iz are razed after heavy fighting. 

4718 AR Hopes for a lasting peace in Brevoy are dashed when the head of House Lebeda is accused of treason, interrupting a potential marriage alliance between House Lebeda and reigning House Surtova. 

4719 AR The Whispering Tyrant breaks free. Most of the remaining holy champions in Mendev ride south to confront the lich, leaving Nerosyan under the rule of Chancellor Irahai.

## NOTABLE FIGURES

The following figures are important to the Broken Lands

**KHISMAR CROOKCHAR**

Khismar stayed in Starfall after most of his colleagues in the Technic League fled, intending to stamp out his League rivals and assert his control over Numeria.

**CHANCELLOR IRAHAI**

Appointed by Queen Galfrey to oversee Mendev, Chancellor Irahai is a tall, calmvoiced woman of Thuvian extraction whose parents were crusaders.

**KEVOTH-KUL**

Once a warlord ruled by ambition, then an addict ruled by his appetites, the Black Sovereign of Numeria is slowly shaking free of his advisors and addictions.

**NATALA SURTOVA**

The sister of King Noleski of Brevoy and de facto queen of the nation, Natala Surtova exerts arguably more influence over local politics than the actual ruler.

## ECONOMICS 

Brevoy is one of the major exporters of food in the region. Rostland produces timber, grain, fruit, vegetables, and livestock, while Issia produces dried and salted fish, pickled clams, and freshwater pearls. Imports include finished goods, cloth, spices, and books. 

Mendev must import nearly everything necessary for survival. Numeria exports skymetal, smuggled technology fragments, and the hides and teeth of the strange animals that roam its wastes, as well as live, captured specimens. Its main imports are food, alcohol, and jewelry. Razmiran is another major exporter of food, as well as cloth, lumber, and fine woodwork. It imports alchemical, herbal, and medicinal supplies.

## CASANDALEE 

The Iron Goddess began her existence as an android, falling to Golarion during the Rain of Stars. After living among the organic lifeforms of this world for millennia, she became a digital intelligence, then ascended to divinity in the heart of Silver Mount. As a goddess, Casandalee seeks both to advance the development of artificial intelligences and establish harmony between artificial and organic life-forms. Her faith is newly founded and little known outside Numeria.

## RAZMIR 

Born mortal, the masked wizard Razmir claims to have ascended to godhood by passing the Test of the *Starstone* in distant Absalom. He founded his faith in the River Kingdoms, rapidly conquering the Arch-Duchy of Melcat and smaller kingdoms through intimidation and mass destruction. Now his grip on Razmiran is complete, and his agents continually seek to expand his theocracy by undermining neighboring lands. 

The clergy holds all power in Razmiran. Promotion is won less by acts of faith than by seizing territory. Most often, this is achieved by establishing a temple in an impoverished, desperate community outside the nation, and pushing grateful new converts to clamor for annexation.

## HUZURIS 

The tribes of old Sarkoris were famed for their mystical witch-wardens, their painted warriors, and the idols they called huzuris. Each huzuri began with the bleached skull of an animal significant to that tribe, either because it represented their totem spirit or because that individual beast shaped the tribe’s history. A fall-fattened bear who appeared before hunters on the brink of starvation and a loyal war dog who saved a clan chief in battle might equally become honored huzuris after death.

Once consecrated by the tribe’s oldest witch, the huzuri became integral to the tribe’s ancestor-based magic, and was often believed to be the repository in which the spirit of the tribe itself lived. 

Each successive witch and chief, upon attaining that title, pressed a fingertip soaked in their own blood to the bare skull. That crimson fingerprint stored its maker’s memories, and so the collective history of the tribe was recorded in spirit-magic, blood, and bone. If a tribe’s huzuri was ever lost or destroyed, the ancient Sarkorians believed that the tribe’s soul was lost as well.

## RELATIONS 

Foreign relations in the Broken Lands are limited. Brevoy and Mendev maintain diplomatic ties with each other and have a nominal presence in the other countries. Razmiran maintains small embassy-temples in a few River Kingdoms, but its other neighbors range from unwelcoming to openly hostile toward it, as the theocracy’s agents are known for undermining outside societies.

The River Kingdoms send out envoys decided at each year’s Outlaw Council, but these representatives seldom have clear direction or duties, since the River Kingdoms are too fractious to set policy as a group. Numeria’s government— never truly organized to begin with—has almost entirely dissolved following the collapse of the Technic League, and does not currently engage in formal diplomacy.
