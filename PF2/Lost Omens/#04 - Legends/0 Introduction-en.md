# Introduction

Golarion is a land made up of impenetrable forests, precipitous mountains, underground cities, vast oceans, sprawling metropolises, massive fortresses, labyrinthine dungeons, and, of course, monsters. But it is also populated by people, from the rulers of empires to the rebels that work to bring down their regimes, and everything in between. 

Heroes must navigate relationships with a variety of people to further their quests, including smugglers, mages, scholars, artists, wealthy collectors, evangelists, and charlatans. From encounters with the people that populate their world, PCs can make friends, learn new skills, buy armor and weapons, gain information, and even enjoy a good meal. As adventurers become more powerful, authority figures might draw them into complex strategies and schemes or ask them to solve complicated problems. 

Heroes might spend only a single hour or a day with a given NPC, or they might form enduring friendships and relationships. So too might these characters become one-time enemies or even persistent antagonists; heroes might repeatedly encounter the same opponents, as the fortunes of war and the rise and fall of different nations and philosophies shape their world. 

The Age of Lost Omens setting is rich in notable NPCs (non-player characters). This collection brings together a wide variety of the most memorable movers and shakers of the setting, as well as characters who have recently risen to the forefront. 

The Inner Sea region has evolved, shaped by the paroxysms of intense magic, the movements of armies, and the actions of tremendous heroes over the past decade. The pages ahead detail the lives and the connections among the powerful and the iconoclastic, the evil and the idealistic, the long renowned and the newly famous. 

Although these NPCs are spread throughout the world, they don’t exist in a vacuum. Many of them know each other, either as allies or enemies, and each entry describes connections that the NPC has with other NPCs in this book. These connections aren’t exhaustive; if your story demands it, practically any NPC presented here can have a connection to any other. 

At the very least, as these NPCs are all so notable in the world, each of them is very likely aware of the others. Where the notable NPCs presented in this book have relationships or rivalries with NPCs that aren’t fully detailed here, the text or sidebars instead include brief character information enclosed in parentheses, such as **Xleighlei** (LN female elf martial artist). 

For the GM, having a robust set of NPCs is a must for providing an immersive and engaging game. A solid knowledge of the motives, behaviors, and pasts of these influential characters adds greater depth. These portraits can help a GM gain a better understanding of a corner of Golarion that is new to them—the interactions between the linnorm kings and Baba Yaga, for example, or the relationships among the Bellflower Network, the Firebrands, and the rebels of Vidrian. 

GMs can use the pages that follow to bring these NPCs to life, whether to vividly sketch a certain scenario or place or to formulate new plot hooks. There’s nothing like the threat of the brig of Hurricane Queen Tessa Fairwind’s pirate ship to heighten the drama for your players!

## CAMPAIGN ELEMENTS

Some of these NPC entries also include a tangible element associated with the character, such as a message, a map, or a portion of a contract. The GM may provide these items as handouts to the players to represent in-world documents or artifacts that relate to the NPC, and they can serve as springboards to further adventures. 

For the player, this book provides a window into many of the regions, philosophies, and relationships that shape Golarion, as well as a number of potential allies and rivals. A player might also find intriguing tidbits about organizations and philosophies that their character would want to follow, potentially drawing from these portraits to complete a compelling backstory or to explore a new direction for their character. 

Players might also want to read up on these various luminaries for more concrete reasons. Some of the following sections include rare elements for use in play, such as new feats, previously unknown spells, and unique magic items. To gain access to these rare options or items, heroes must meet the person in question (for those still living and whose whereabouts are known) or otherwise pursue their legacy. 

Thus, players might be inspired to suggest encounters or even quests involving these notable actors on the Inner Sea region’s wide stage. The entries also contain adventure hooks that might bring the heroes into contact with the NPC or even spawn campaigns of their own. In some cases, the NPC might have a mission they need loyal agents to perform, while other entries include motives that might put the heroes into conflict with the NPC. 

In either case, these stories and portraits are intended to provide seeds of encounters or adventures that allow the heroes to gain access to the new rules elements provided with each NPC. Remember that the GM is the ultimate arbiter in granting these rewards. 

A richer experience in the Age of Lost Omens setting awaits anyone who gets to know these intriguing characters. Their actions and passions have had an outsized influence in shaping the Inner Sea region, and that influence continues to this day.

## SPOILERS AHEAD!

Many of the NPCs showcased in this book have been involved in major events and occurrences within the Inner Sea region. These events often coincide with Pathfinder Adventure Paths: pre-written campaigns that offer player characters the chance to be a part of Golarion’s ongoing history. 

While Lost Omens: Legends does its best not to spoil every twist and turn that players might encounter over the course of these Adventure Paths, it does make assumptions about how the Adventure Paths ended, and the very presence of certain NPCs within this book may provide spoilers for the ultimate fate of various characters. 

Characters that feature in prominent roles within Adventure Paths are accompanied by a sidebar labeled “Familiar Faces,” which indicates where these NPCs previously appeared.

# SIDEBARS

## MAJOR EVENTS 

*Lost Omens: Legends* features many NPCs who are or have been involved in major global events. These events are large enough that player characters might also have been involved before the start of a campaign, or might be pulled into their wake. Either way, getting player characters involved in major storylines in the Age of Lost Omens is an excellent way for characters to meet or know of these NPCs. Some of these storylines are below. 

### The Devastation of Geb and Nex 

In the very distant past, two powerful and egotistical wizards encountered one another, leading to a series of events that spiraled into all-out war. Despite the bloodshed ending over 4,000 years ago, the land where they fought hasn’t recovered to this day. 

### General Manumission 

In response to a sudden attack on the prominent city of Absalom, Siege Lord Wynsal Starborn offered freedom to any slave willing to fight in defense of their home, and later banned slavery entirely. The closure of a huge market for slaves, alongside other major abolitionist efforts, provided an economic push for many other nations to ban slavery in response, much to the displeasure of the slavers. 

### The Ironfang Invasion 

An army of hobgoblins and other monstrous peoples swept through the region near Lake Encarthan—in part out of revenge for a previous war that cost thousands of lives. Though the militia of Nirmathas managed to forge peace and potentially end the cycle of violence, many people aren’t happy with their decision to form a truce with their enemies. 

### New Thassilon 

The ancient Thassilonian mages known as the runelords have been troubling Varisia for the last decade, starting with the return and defeat of Runelord Karzoug. Recently an entire ancient Thassilonian city appeared in Varisia, alongside two more of the ancient runelords, Belimarius and Sorshen.

### The Ravounel Rebellion 

Many seek freedom from Cheliax’s tyranny. Rebels in the nation of Ravounel gained succession from Cheliax, but a similar Westcrown uprising called the Glorious Reclamation was crushed by Cheliax’s forces. 

### Revolution in Vidrian 

The former Chelaxian colony of Sargava in the Mwangi Expanse had been plagued by financial difficulties for decades. After the colony missed one too many payments to the local soldiers, the disgruntled army joined forces with the oppressed indigenous Mwangi in order to overthrow the colonial government. 

### War Against Tar-Baphon 

The lich Tar-Baphon was imprisoned centuries ago but has been trying to break free ever since. He succeeded a year ago and mustered his undead forces to march upon Absalom, though he was routed by extraordinary heroes.
