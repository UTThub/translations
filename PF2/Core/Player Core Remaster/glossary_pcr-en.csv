While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack modifier, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately, and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",

,,structure,structure,,,"structure (trait) An item with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can’t be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure’s foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse. The structure doesn’t harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can’t be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when the item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when the activation ends isn’t harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure.",
